## üêõ **What do this plugin**
The Minecraft plugin I've created is designed to manage spawn points for multiple worlds within a server. Each world can have its own designated spawn location, complete with specific coordinates and custom messages displayed to players upon teleportation. The configuration is handled through a ```config.yml``` file, which allows server administrators to easily set up and modify the spawn points and messages for each world. For example, the plugin can teleport players to different worlds like Minage, Nether, and Faction, each with unique messages and coordinates. Additionally, it supports teleportation to a central hub world, providing a cohesive and customizable experience for players.

The configuration in the config.yml file includes a section for each world under #Spawns. Here is an example setup:
```yml
#Spawns
#-----------------[Exemple]-------------------
# WorldName: 
#  message: "&6Message when the player tp on world with command"
#    x: 0 Co on x
#    y: 0 Co on y
#    z: 0 Co on z
#    a: 0 Co on y of player view
#    b: 0 Co on x of player view
#----------------------------------------------------

  Minage:
    message: "&teleportation on &b&lMinage"
    x: 0
    y: 0
